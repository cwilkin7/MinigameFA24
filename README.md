Welcome to Goblin Boxer
You play the role of the brave boxing knight, sir Smith as you are defending the last castle wall from a goblin invasion
The Controls are that you move with W & S to control Sir Smith
Everytime you press Space, you send out two "Shockwaves."
All of the Art assets were created by myself using the 2D art software, Pixilart.
I designed it so that each goblin ran at a different speed and each of them had health values.
Goblin 2 (The Speed Goblin) has 5 health and moves at a fast speed
Goblin 1 (The Regular Goblin) has 20 health and moves at a moderate speed
Goblin 3 (The Tough Goblin) has 50 health and moves at a slower speed
!NOTE!
W & S and A & D work as opposites. So W and S control left and right and A and D control up and down
